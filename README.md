A game about exploring floating islands in your airship. inspired by airships-qts (airship mechanics), terraria (exploaration and combat) ,barotrauma (missions and perhaps coop mp) and forts (weapon mechanics).
The game is still in very early development
I dont have an actual name for this yet
also the code is undocumented and made of spagetti
The game uses the godot engine
